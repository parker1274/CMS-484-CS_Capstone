File for creating the models

Will take the following inputs:
- model_type (Classifier or regressor for now, others later)
- TeamA_abbreviation (Team for the outcome we want)
- TeamB_abbreviation (Other team in the matchup)
- season (Always the current season, then goes back based on the number of season)
- number_seasons (Number of seasons we want going back for the current season)
- number_past_games (The number of recent games we want to get the average stats from for the model)
